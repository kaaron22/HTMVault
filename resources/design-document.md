# HTM Vault

## 1. Problem Statement

"HTM Vault" is a medical device service documentation system used to store a detailed inventory of devices for a given medical facility, along with records of work performed on each device.

"HTM Vault" will assist Healthcare Technology Management service providers in maintaining an accurate, up-to-date list of devices under contract, allowing them to keep track of preventive maintenance due dates and whether a device is in compliance or not, among other features. Additionally, records of work performed will provide the ability to detail the results of initial acceptance testing, preventive maintenance, and/or repairs for a given device.
